- There is no way to measure how similar the original image looks compared to the drawn image
- Problem with self collision

  - Can iiwa reach all the points within its reachability map without colliding with the wall

- Cannot use integration properly

  - Current situation
    - Works with real robot
    - cannot visualize drawing result with gazebo -> find a way to draw in gazebo?
    - rviz does not function properlt -> complex problem to solve

- my job:
  - Alter orientation with follow trajectory.py
  - Think of way to avoid self collision (iiwa)
  - Find a way to draw in gazebo
