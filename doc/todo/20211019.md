- Make iiwa + ridgeback communication system (with Eunjung)
- Improve ridgeback alignment :black_heart:
  - align -> move 1m -> get values -> realign based on difference
- Improve trajectory planning algorithm
- Test which topic is best for getting ridgeback movement information
  - Real robot
    - Odometry: tells how much ridgeback moved after launching(?)
  - TRACKERRRRRRRRRR
- Improve localization

  - TRACKERRRRRRRRRR

- Future:
  - Improve localization -> make a system that finishes the picture color by color ( y -> m -> c -> k)

- Check:
  - When does ridgeback start malfunctioning during alignment?
  - What is the threshold in diverse scripts / real / simulation?
  - What code works in simulation / real robot?

- Create
  - Worksheet structure to keep track of daily progress & share with team
