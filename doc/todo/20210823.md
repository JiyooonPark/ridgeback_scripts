- We are currentle dseling with surfaces

- Have to store Surface information

  - Use mesh file
  - Can use openGL to read the mesh files, but will do it manually
  - manually = person reads/interperates file and picks out needed information
    -> mesh file needs to be in ascii format
    -> use assimp-util to convert between file formats
    -> assimp export current_mesh.obj new_mesh.stl

- Mesh file format:

  - .stl (X)
  - .obj (O)

- .obj files

  - stores vertex normals instead of face normals
  - We pass pose & orientation to iiwa -> calculate point normals

- Process information

  - quadtree < kdtree

- How to read mesh files

  1. manually interperate .obj format files
  2. mesh -> point cloud
  3. use LiDAR to sense distance & shape of object

- Conclusion

  - Use mesh with volume in gazebo
  - Use 2D surface curve when calculating

- TIP
  - when using blender, geometry option - light material (x) -> export
